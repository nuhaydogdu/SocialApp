To develop a service-based modern dynamic application, I developed an example dating site called SocialApp.

I learned how to write ASP net core web api services and how to develop front-end using Angular 9 as the client application type.

## Application features:
- SQL Database with Entity Framework Core. 
- CRUD operations over the service. 
- Creating User with Asp net Core Identity. 
- User Identification with Token Based Authentication. 
- Consumption of Service Information by Angular 9. 
- Creating Users in Angular 9. 
- Working with User Token Information in Angular 9.
